## ðŸš€ Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

- [Shrink Boxing](https://mattycalimbas.github.io/fatboyshrinkboxing/) - An extensively developed website constructed using only HTML and CSS. To enhance its design and layout, CSS frameworks like Bootstrap were employed. This project was conceived as a proof of concept to demonstrate the potential for a frontend makeover to a client.
- [Portfolio Template](https://github.com/MattyCalimbas/portfolio) - Crafted with precision using HTML and CSS, this personal portfolio template showcases extensive front-end development skills. Leveraging the power of CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, I have elevated the design and layout to deliver a seamless user experience. 
- [Beverage Selector](https://beerselector-production.up.railway.app/) - This is a personal portfolio project that is still a WIP. This is a near-fully functioning web application that helps a user select beer given personal taste. This web application employs Express and Angular 7 to parse the Punk API database for beers. All data is displayed within a single HTML page.
